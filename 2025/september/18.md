## What I Learned

- Today learning more about Typescript / Javascript
- Get more familiar with objects, variables, switch statements, if's, logic.

## Challenges

- Only course, and challenges from course.

## Reflection

- Reflecting about all objects and if's logics, this is so useful, seeing so much advantages, why in css isn't an objects. :(
