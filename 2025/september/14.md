## What I Learned

- Next day with practising HTML,CSS
- Learning about transitioning, animations, building more complex components.
- Learning more complexity grid, subgrid.

## Challenges

- Much challenges from course
- Introduction to biggest project in course
- Do some private projects, check GitHub
- Trying to make some advanced site.

## Reflection

- Quite good, but subgrid isn't easy for me right now. Trying to learn anyway :D
