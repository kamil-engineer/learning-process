## What I Learned

- CSS in action, paddings, margins, positioning, flexbox, css-grid
- Learn what is flexbox, what is css-grid, how to use them.
- Watch some tutorials about variables, typography system based on developers recommendations.

## Challenges

- Tutorial challenges, recipe page.

## Reflection

- A lot of informations, dont know yet when to use flexbox and css-grid. Terms about paddings,margins,positioning is general easy, but need to practice them.
  Struggling while reading articles about variables, typography, design system, quite hard i think, but i see how worth it going be.
